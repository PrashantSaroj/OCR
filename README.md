# OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
''' Based on Artificial Neural Networks '''
''' Algorithms used - backpropagation and feedforward propagation '''

## Pre-requisite
1. Put all repo file in MATLAB workspace folder

## Getting Started
1. Train the model using Main.m file
2. After training Theta1 and Theta2 will be loaded in workspace variables
3. Theta1 and Theta2 are parameters of neural networks
4. Resize test image to 20x20 and reshape it to 400x1 feature vector
5. Pass Theta1, Theta2, feature vector to function predict()
6. Corresponding output will be label ( 10 is mapped to 0)
